//STEP 1 -> Create a computerPlay function that randomly returns rock, paper, or scissors

function computerPlay() {
    let result = Math.floor(Math.random() * ((3 - 1) + 1) + 1);
    
    if (result == 1) {
        return "rock";
    }else if (result == 2) {
        return "paper";
    }else{
        return "scissors";
    }
}

//STEP 2 -> Create a function that plays a single round that takes two parameters:
//1)playerSelection & computerSelection which returns a string that declares the winner:
//"You lose! Paper beats Rock"
//return results of function call not console.log()
//also make users input case insensitive (rock, Rock, RocK)

function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {

    playerSelection.toLowerCase();

    if (playerSelection === "rock" && computerSelection ===  "paper") {
        return "You Lose! Paper beats Rock";
    }else if (playerSelection === "scissors" && computerSelection ===  "rock") {
        return "You Lose! Rock beats Scissors";
    }else if (playerSelection === "paper" && computerSelection ===  "scissors") {
        return "You Lose! Scissors beats Paper";
    }else if (playerSelection === "paper" && computerSelection ===  "rock") {
        return "You Win! Paper beats Rock";
    }else if (playerSelection === "rock" && computerSelection ===  "scissors") {
        return "You Win! Rock beats Scissors";
    }else if (playerSelection === "scissors" && computerSelection ===  "paper") {
        return "You Win! Scissors beats Paper";
    }else{
        return "Tie!";
    }

}


//STEP 3 -> Write a function called game() that uses the previous function inside
//this one to play 5 round game that keeps score and reports winner & loser at end
//for now, continue to display results of each round using console.log
//use prompt() to get user input
//feel free to change previous function's return values to something more useful
//feel free to use helper functions if more useful

let playerWins = 0;
let computerWins = 0;
let gameRound = 0;

function gameResult() {
    if (playerWins == 3 || gameRound == 5 && playerWins > computerWins) {
        console.log("YOU WIN!!!");
    }else if (computerWins == 3 || gameRound == 5 && playerWins < computerWins) {
        console.log("YOU LOSE!!!");
        console.log("GAME OVER...");
    }else if (gameRound == 5 && playerWins == computerWins) {
        console.log("TIE GAME!");
        console.log("Try again?");
    }
}

function gameReset() {
    if (gameRound == 5) {
        playerWins = 0;
        computerWins = 0;
        gameRound = 0;
    }
}

function game() {

    const playerSelection = prompt("Rock, Paper, or Scissors?", "");
    const computerSelection = computerPlay();

    console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection));

    if (playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) === "You Lose! Paper beats Rock" || playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) === "You Lose! Rock beats Scissors" || playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) === "You Lose! Scissors beats Paper") {
        console.log(`Round: ${++gameRound}`);
        console.log(`User: ${playerWins} Computer: ${++computerWins}`)

        console.log(`Round: ${++gameRound}`);
        console.log(`User: ${++playerWins} Computer: ${computerWins}`)
    }else{
